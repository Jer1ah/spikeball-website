            <h1>Game Mods</h1>
            <h3>The Blue Shell and Lightning Bolt make things so much more interesting in Mario Kart. Here are Spikeball’s versions:</h3>
            <span><p><strong>T-Rex Arms:</strong> all players must have their arms (up to their wrists) inside their sleeves for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NcHwi5UoaI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <span><p><strong>The floor is Lava:</strong> the ball can bounce off the ground once per possession for both teams.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Double Trouble:</strong> winning counts for 2 points for both teams.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Ambidextrous:</strong> your opponents can only use their off-hand.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Infinity Touch:</strong> your team has unlimited touches.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Infinity Serve:</strong> your server has unlimited faults but once they get it on net the point starts.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Flexing:</strong> whichever team loses has to immediately do 20 push-ups.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Sharp Shooter:</strong> your opponents server has to serve from twice the normal distance.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>T-Rex Arms:</strong> all players must have their arms (up to their wrists) inside their sleeves for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Kill them with Kindness:</strong> both teams can only win on a drop shot.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Don't Mess Up:</strong> it is -2 points if either team hits rim.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Deuces:</strong> your opponents only get two touches per possession.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Trampoline Shirt:</strong> All players must use their shirt as a ball trampoline on the second hit of a rally.</p></span>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PoXn5_eAW-g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <span><p><strong>Freeze:</strong> one player on the opposing team can’t move from a pre-decided location for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Sly Five:</strong> at any time in a rally you can yell "SLY FIVE" and the opposing team must high five in the next 5 seconds or they lose the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Food for Thought:</strong> each player must yell the opposite hand of whichever one they are hitting with. (ex. when hitting with your right hand you yell “LEFT”).</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Takes two to Tango:</strong> all players must hold hands with their teammates for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Mortor Combat:</strong> at any point in your possession your team can yell “MORTOR COMBAT” and wherever the ball lands you get to pick it up and throw it back towards the net resuming the rally with normal hits.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Double Down:</strong> call double down before the start of a point and the winning team receives 2 points instead of 1.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Fire Extinguisher:</strong> changes who’s serving on the opposing team. Example if Opponent A hit two aces in a row call Fire Extinguisher so his partner takes possession of the serve.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Pirates Booty:</strong> All players must jump up and down on one leg for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K343_nQutq8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <span><p><strong>Double Cross:</strong> trade partners with your opponent. Can only be used if your team is behind by 7 or more points.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Yahtzee:</strong> one player starts the point holding an extra ball. This player must hold on to this ball throughout the point until he or she yells Yahtzee! At this point the extra ball becomes the active ball for the point. The “original” ball can be completely ignored. Immediately after Yahtzee is called the player must pass the new ball to his partner, this pass counts as the team’s first touch of the possession.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Simon Says:</strong> call this before a point and the server has to announce what serve they are going to hit before they hit it.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Simon Sez:</strong> call this before a point and the reciever gets to tell the server what type of serve he/she must hit.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Small Ball:</strong> for the next point the ball can take two bounces on the net (no rim).</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Bottoms Up:</strong> losers of the next point owe the winners a 6-pack.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Hals Pals:</strong> players must keep at least one foot touching the ground at all times during the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Sassy:</strong> players can only use the back of their hands to strike the ball.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>There's a me in Team:</strong> passes do not have to alternate between players, consecutive touches are allowed.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Use your Noggin':</strong> you must win the point by incorporating a head hit at some point in the rally or it doesn’t count.</p></span>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LP1GBzWAkc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <span><p><strong>Stranger Things:</strong> the next point is played with the net flipped upsidedown.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Fingers Crossed:</strong> for the next three serves the opposing team must have their eyes closed when serving.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>The Bee's Knees:</strong> for the next point everyone must play on their knees.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Love Love:</strong> the game must be played with tennis rackets.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Try Hards:</strong> players can only use closed fists to hit the ball.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Blood in the Water:</strong> either team can yell "Blood in the water!" during a rally when the other team has possession if they are feeling confident. Winners of the point get +2 and losers get -2 points.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Dito:</strong> your opponents must hit with the same hands to hit the ball in the same order (right, left, left).</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Banana Split:</strong> if a player can do the splits mid rally and still win the point the opposing team owes them a banana.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Going the Distance:</strong> players who are not the sever or receiver must start the point standing 20 ft away from the net.</p></span>

            <span><p><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> both teams must use at least one foot touch before finishing a point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Depth over Distance:</strong> every player must play with one eye closed for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Double Trouble:</strong> each time you touch the ball you have to bounce it up to yourself first.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Star Spangled Manners:</strong> you must say "thank you" every time your partner sets or passes to you. Loss of point for every unsaid "thank you".</p></span>

            <span><p><strong>Sisyphus:</strong> for the next point you get to choose one player on the opposing team to play on their hands and knees for the duration of the point.</p></span>
            <span><p><strong>Friendly Fire:</strong> both teams can only win a point from the opposing team making an offensive mistake. Kill shots will result in a do over.</p></span>
